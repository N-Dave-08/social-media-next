# üéâ Production Deployment Success Story

## Overview

**Date**: September 2024  
**Status**: **SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED** üöÄ  
**Infrastructure**: AWS ECS + RDS + ALB + ECR  
**Result**: Social media app fully functional in production

### **üåê Production Website**
**Live Application**: [http://social-media-alb-1380272211.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com](http://social-media-alb-1380272211.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com)

**Verification**: ‚úÖ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**
- Website loads successfully
- Database connection established
- User signup functionality working
- All API endpoints responding correctly
- No more 500 Internal Server Errors

## üèÜ What We Accomplished

### 1. Production Infrastructure Setup ‚úÖ
- **ECS Cluster** with Fargate tasks for container orchestration
- **RDS PostgreSQL** database for production data
- **Application Load Balancer** for traffic distribution
- **ECR Container Registry** for Docker image storage
- **VPC** with proper security groups and network isolation

### 2. Database Connection Issues Resolved ‚úÖ
- **Fixed DATABASE_URL configuration** - From generic `postgres:5432` to full RDS endpoint
- **Resolved environment variable conflicts** - ECS task definition vs Docker `.env` file
- **Implemented automatic schema creation** - Using `prisma db push` for initial deployments
- **Established stable RDS connectivity** - No more connection timeouts

### 3. Application Deployment Success ‚úÖ
- **Docker image building** and ECR pushing with proper authentication
- **ECS service deployment** and scaling with health checks
- **Load balancer configuration** and target group registration
- **Production environment** fully operational

## üîç The Problem We Solved

### Initial Issue: 500 Internal Server Error
```json
{
  "error": "Database connection failed",
  "details": "Invalid `prisma.user.count()` invocation: The table `public.users` does not exist in the current database."
}
```

### Root Causes Identified:
1. **Wrong DATABASE_URL** - Using localhost instead of RDS endpoint
2. **Environment variable conflicts** - ECS task definition overrides `.env` file
3. **Missing database tables** - Prisma migrations haven't run
4. **Network connectivity** - Security groups blocking database access

## üí° Key Lessons Learned

### Lesson 1: Environment Variable Precedence
**Critical Discovery**: ECS task definition environment variables **OVERRIDE** Docker image `.env` files.

**What Happened:**
- Docker image had `DATABASE_URL=postgres:5432`
- ECS had `DATABASE_URL=rds-endpoint:5432`
- ECS won, but app tried to connect to non-existent `postgres:5432`

**Solution**: Ensure `.env` file matches ECS task definition exactly.

### Lesson 2: Database Schema Management
**Critical Decision**: Use `prisma db push` for initial production deployments, not `prisma migrate deploy`.

**Why This Matters:**
- Initial deployments failed because database tables didn't exist
- Migrations couldn't run on empty database
- App crashed with "table does not exist" errors

**Solution**: Use `prisma db push` for initial setup, then `prisma migrate deploy` for updates.

### Lesson 3: Production vs Development Configuration
**Critical Understanding**: Production requires actual service endpoints, not generic container names.

**The Problem:**
- Using `postgres:5432` in production points to nothing
- Causes connection timeouts and 500 Internal Server Errors
- Generic container names don't exist in production environments

**Solution**: Use full RDS endpoint: `social-media-postgres.rds.amazonaws.com:5432`

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed DATABASE_URL Configuration
```env
# ‚ùå WRONG - Local container reference
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/social_media_db?schema=public"

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Full RDS endpoint
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@social-media-postgres.c7sgoummmk7f.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/social_media_db?schema=public"
```

### 2. Updated Dockerfile for Database Schema
```dockerfile
# Before: prisma migrate deploy (failed on empty database)
CMD ["sh", "-c", "npx prisma migrate deploy && node server.js"]

# After: prisma db push (creates schema from scratch)
CMD ["sh", "-c", "echo 'Waiting for database connection...' && npx prisma db push --accept-data-loss && echo 'Database schema updated successfully' && node server.js"]
```

### 3. Environment Variable Consistency
- **Local development**: Uses `localhost:5432` via Docker Compose
- **Production**: Uses full RDS endpoint via ECS task definition
- **No conflicts**: Both environments use appropriate configurations

## üìä Success Metrics

### Infrastructure Health ‚úÖ
- **ECS cluster**: Running with 1 healthy task

## üöÄ Deployment Process

### Step-by-Step Success Path:
1. **Identified the problem** - Database connection failures
2. **Root cause analysis** - Environment variable conflicts
3. **Implemented solution** - Fixed DATABASE_URL and Dockerfile

# 2. Updated Dockerfile to use prisma db push
# 3. Rebuilt Docker image
docker build -t social-media-app-test:latest .

# 4. Pushed to ECR
docker tag social-media-app-test:latest 337909777510.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/social-media-app:latest
